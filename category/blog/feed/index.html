<h2>Burp Suite Workshop</h2>



<p>Gain hands-on experience with Burp Suite in this three hour workshop with the author of the Burp Suite Cookbook, Sunny Wear. She will teach you how to start using Burp Suite like a pro!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outline:</p>



<p>Workshop Agenda:</p>



<p>Materials, Lab Setup&nbsp;<br>Calibrating Burp&nbsp;<br>Intruding with Intruder&nbsp;<br>Attacking the Client&nbsp;<br>Extending Functionality with Extensions&nbsp;<br>Writing Burp Macros&nbsp;</p>



<p>Student Requirements:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each student must provide their own Laptop:&nbsp;<br>Operating System: Windows 7 or above (with admin privilege)&nbsp;<br>OR Any Linux Distro&nbsp;<br>OR MAC RAM: Minimum 4GB (but 8GB is preferred)&nbsp;<br>Hard disk: Minimum 50GB free space&nbsp;<br>Oracle Virtual Box&nbsp;</p>



<p>Software will be provided via a USB drive but having VB already installed will accelerate the process for getting students into the content.</p>



<h2>A Modern and Practical Introduction to Software Reverse Engineering</h2>



<p>Taught by Hahna Kane Latonick and Kevin Fujimoto</p>



<p>OVERVIEW&nbsp;</p>



<p>This course introduces students to software reverse engineering using a modern and practical approach. Students will walk away from this class knowing how to reverse x64 and x86 binaries. We believe it’s best to learn by doing; therefore, the concepts covered in this training will be taught primarily through hands-on exercises using modern tools for static analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus, we immediately dive into analyzing binaries. We get everyone up to speed by briefly covering x64 assembly, so that you can analyze any x64 or x86 binary without the need for source code. Using key features of IDA Pro, we’ll reverse engineer binaries to identify data types and operators. We’ll recognize control flow patterns and understand arithmetic sequences. We’ll dissect function calls, calling conventions, and program structures. Using the disassembler, we’ll cover memory layout and addressing, including registers, the stack, heap, and memory segments. We’ll then master low-level analysis of pointers, arrays, and structures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each step of the way, students will be solving binary puzzles that are reflective of real-word applications to learn the concept at hand. By the end of this class, students will have the necessary skills to reverse engineer binaries for offensive and defensive applications as well as for fun in CTF competitions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>COURSE OUTLINE&nbsp;</p>



<p>4-Hour Half-Day Workshop&nbsp;<br>● Introduction to x64 assembly&nbsp;<br>● Introduction to IDA Pro&nbsp;<br>● Static Analysis Methodology&nbsp;<br>● Lab exercises throughout entire workshop&nbsp;</p>



<p>WHO SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you’re a security professional, security enthusiast, or hobbyist, this course is for anyone who wants to figure out how to analyze, understand, and modify software without source code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>STUDENT REQUIREMENTS&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some knowledge of x86 assembly is required. Students should be comfortable with the basics of the C programming language. Familiarity with C++ or Python is a plus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WHAT STUDENTS SHOULD BRING&nbsp;</p>



<p>Students should bring a laptop with VMware installed, and at least 50 GB of free disk space. VMs with examples, tools, and exercises will be distributed in class via USB sticks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WHAT STUDENTS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instructors will provide a USB stick loaded with course slides and the complete reverse engineering environment for the class, including tools, sample code, and lab exercises.</p><p>The post <a href="https://bsidesorlando.org/2019/workshops-post/">Workshops</a> first appeared on <a href="https://bsidesorlando.org/2019">Security B-Sides Orlando 2019</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve made some changes this year to our workshops that we think will help grow BSides Orlando and the talent in the Central Florida community. We have also dedicated ourselves to being transparent about decisions regarding the conference as this is a community event and you are our community.</p>



<p>In previous years all workshops have been 100% free. However, recently we&#8217;ve received feedback that attendees want more technical content, training, and workshops for people who are mid-level in their careers. We also have the opportunity to engage some world class trainers in workshops. To that end we decided to see how we could balanced paid training with our driving ethos of helping grow students and professionals new to security. </p>



<p><strong>We will continue to offer free workshops</strong>, but we will also begin to offer some high quality low cost workshops that allow us to bring in professionals from the field to provide training. Our goal is this:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Keep costs for paid workshops low: $50-$100</strong> &#8211; This price range is something many students can still afford while also being a price professionals looking for training can manage.</li><li><strong>Cover travel for trainers when needed</strong> &#8211; Too often conferences ask for favors of professionals to spread knowledge. Our community is amazing, but if we don&#8217;t help them offset some travel costs we are essentially asking them to pay for the privilege of improving our conference. We don&#8217;t want to be that conference.</li><li><strong>For some trainers training is their job</strong> &#8211; In some cases, we may engage professional trainers that may be compensated for their time. Generally this is in the form of some revenue sharing of the seat count in the class. When we have this type of arrangement it allows the conference to be better and benefits the attendees. The Board will discuss all professional training options and make a decision based on the benefit to the attendees. The goal will always be to deliver the content at low or no cost to attendees.</li><li><strong>Any money made after covering costs will go into a speaker travel fund</strong> &#8211; We are very excited about this! Essentially, for those that can afford to purchase paid training that money will go into a fund to help cover travel for nationally known technical professionals to come speak at B-Sides Orlando in the future. This will help ensure that students just breaking into the field can hear from some of the best in the business without those pros paying out of pocket to travel to our conference</li></ol>



<p>Our goal is always to keep B-Sides Orlando 100% free for students. However, with the feedback we received last year adding some paid workshops strikes a good balance between serving the community, taking care of the people sharing their knowledge through training, and taking any money made and feeding it back into the conference to improve the experience without raising ticket prices<br><br>Let us know what you think and keep an eye out for workshops soon!<br><br>Ean </p><p>The post <a href="https://bsidesorlando.org/2019/changes-to-workshops-this-year/">Changes to Workshops</a> first appeared on <a href="https://bsidesorlando.org/2019">Security B-Sides Orlando 2019</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<ul><li>This year we moved from Eventbrite to BusyConf in an effort to move to a blind review where CFP reviewers are unaware of the submitter&#8217;s name. We believe a blind review will remove unintentional bias and give speakers an equal footing on submissions.</li><li>To increase the diversity of the event, our staff has reached out to both women and PoC to encourage speakers from minority groups to submit.</li><li>We have a goal of a 70/30 split of blind review talks to staff picks to ensure that new voices are heard while maintaining a technical core.</li></ul>



<p>We hope these adjustments will improve our content while providing a more diverse set of speakers that represent our local community. </p><p>The post <a href="https://bsidesorlando.org/2019/cfp-2019/">CFP 2019</a> first appeared on <a href="https://bsidesorlando.org/2019">Security B-Sides Orlando 2019</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
