With product-to-market agility as their priority, manufacturers rarely prioritize security resulting in \u201cbolted on\u201d fixes for their products. We\u2019ve provided the hardware, so come try your hand at breaking into common IoT devices. Participants are provided included manuals and tips on getting started.<\/p>\n<p>Make your way to the IoT Hall to get your hack on. Check the B-Sides Orlando website under Event -&gt; Activities for a list of devices to hack. Record your best hack and post it to Twitter with #BSidesOrl2019-IoT.
