Students will walk away from this class knowing how to reverse x64 and x86 binaries. We believe it\u2019s best to learn by doing; therefore, the concepts covered in this training will be taught primarily through hands-on exercises using modern tools for static analysis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, we immediately dive into analyzing binaries. We get everyone up to speed by briefly covering x64 assembly, so that you can analyze any x64 or x86 binary without the need for source code. Using key features of IDA Pro, we\u2019ll reverse engineer binaries to identify data types and operators. We\u2019ll recognize control flow patterns and understand arithmetic sequences. We\u2019ll dissect function calls, calling conventions, and program structures. Using the disassembler, we\u2019ll cover memory layout and addressing, including registers, the stack, heap, and memory segments. We\u2019ll then master low-level analysis of pointers, arrays, and structures.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each step of the way, students will be solving binary puzzles that are reflective of real-word applications to learn the concept at hand. By the end of this class, students will have the necessary skills to reverse engineer binaries for offensive and defensive applications as well as for fun in CTF competitions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>COURSE OUTLINE&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4-Hour Half-Day Workshop&nbsp;<br>\u25cf Introduction to x64 assembly&nbsp;<br>\u25cf Introduction to IDA Pro&nbsp;<br>\u25cf Static Analysis Methodology&nbsp;<br>\u25cf Lab exercises throughout entire workshop&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WHO SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re a security professional, security enthusiast, or hobbyist, this course is for anyone who wants to figure out how to analyze, understand, and modify software without source code.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>STUDENT REQUIREMENTS&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some knowledge of x86 assembly is required. Students should be comfortable with the basics of the C programming language. Familiarity with C++ or Python is a plus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WHAT STUDENTS SHOULD BRING&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students should bring a laptop with VMware installed, and at least 50 GB of free disk space. VMs with examples, tools, and exercises will be distributed in class via USB sticks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WHAT STUDENTS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instructors will provide a USB stick loaded with course slides and the complete reverse engineering environment for the class, including tools, sample code, and lab exercises.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Check out the event registration page for new workshops available!
